<h2 class="center">The lay of Middle Earth</h2><br>
<p>As told in The Silmarillion, most of the events of the First Age 
took place in the land of Beleriand and its environs. Tolkien placed 
within the bounds of Beleriand the hidden Elven kingdoms of Doriath, 
ruled by King Thingol, and Gondolin, founded by Turgon. Also important 
was the fortress of Nargothrond, founded by the elf Finrod Felagund. 
In the Blue Mountains to the east were the great dwarf halls of 
Belegost and Nogrod. Beleriand was split into eastern and western 
sections by the great river Sirion. In East Beleriand was the river 
Gelion with its seven tributaries, which defined the Green-elf kingdom 
of Ossiriand. To the north of Beleriand lay the regions of Nevrast, 
Hithlum and Dor-lómin, and the Iron Mountains where Morgoth (Melkor) 
had his fortress of Angband. The violent struggles during the War of 
Wrath between the Host of the Valar and the armies of Melkor at the 
end of the First Age brought about the destruction of Angband, and 
changed the shape of Middle-earth so that most of Beleriand vanished 
under the sea.</p>

<h2 class="center">The Story Continues</h2><br>
<p>In the Second and Third Ages, during which Tolkien set the 
events of the Akallabêth, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings, 
the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of Eriador, 
Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and the vales of the great river Anduin. 
Eriador was bordered by the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains to the west, 
which bordered the sea and the Grey Havens, also called Mithlond. 
To the east of Eriador lay the Misty Mountains, which ran from the 
far north to Isengard, home of the wizard Saruman, in the south. 
The Misty Mountains contained the great dwarvish hall of Khazad-dûm 
or Moria. Within Eriador lay originally the kingdom of Arnor, founded 
by men who had fled the destruction of Númenor. It later split into 
the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. These kingdoms too 
had long since passed into history by the time of The Lord of the Rings. 
Eriador also contained The Shire, homeland of the Hobbits, and the 
nearby settlement of Bree. Rivendell or Imladris, the home of the 
Half-elven Elrond also lay in Eriador, close to the western side 
of the Misty Mountains.</p>
