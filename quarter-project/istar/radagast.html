<h3>Radagast The Brown</h3>
<p>Radagast lived for much of his time in Middle-earth at 
Rhosgobel in the Vales of Anduin, on the western eaves of 
Mirkwood, between Carrock and the Old Forest Road, near the 
Gladden Fields, its name deriving from Sindarin rhosc gobel 
meaning "brown village".[1] Radagast had a strong affinity 
for – and relationship with – wild animals, and it seemed his 
greatest concern was with the olvar and kelvar (flora and fauna) 
of Middle-earth. He was wiser than any Man in all things 
concerning herbs and beasts. It is said he spoke the many tongues 
of birds, and was a "master of shapes and changes of hue". Radagast 
is also described by Gandalf as "never a traveller, unless driven 
by great need", "a worthy Wizard", and "honest".</p>
