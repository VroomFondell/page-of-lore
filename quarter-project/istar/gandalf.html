<h3>Gandalf The Grey</h3>
<p>Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring 
Narya), for he was the Enemy of Sauron, opposing the fire that 
devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in 
wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled 
in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well 
glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly 
to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and 
the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither 
power nor praise... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning 
on a staff, and so he was called among Men of the North Gandalf 
'the Elf of the Wand'. </p>
